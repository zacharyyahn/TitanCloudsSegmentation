Paper:
- data quality section
- grid methods section
- conclusions
- strength of language
- figure changes
- small edits
- additional figure with a flowchart of the whole pipeline?

Code:
- redo grid methods with individual pixels
- redo brightness histogram stuff?
- recalculate areas and other metrics
- remake all the figures
- global precision, recall, accuracy
- readme and other data availability things

Paper Done:
- filter section (emphasis on data selection to make the problem tractable, not for "high quality"

Code Done:
- retrain model


Notes to be careful of in the text:
- Instance segmentation, not semantic segmentation
- Mask-RCNN, not Resnet
- Curated dataset, not quality metric

Figure out optimal threshold -> Redo predictions -> Redo metrics -> Redo figures
